# Timeframe Bias Indicator Design

## Overview
The timeframe bias indicator will show the dominant trend direction for each timeframe, providing traders with a clear understanding of market momentum across different time horizons. This indicator will be integrated into both the technical analysis module and the recommendation engine to enhance trading decisions.

## Design Goals
1. Calculate trend direction bias for each timeframe (1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, daily)
2. Provide a clear, quantifiable measure of trend strength
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing technical indicators
4. Enhance the recommendation engine with multi-timeframe trend context
5. Maintain the modular architecture of the codebase

## Technical Approach

### Bias Calculation Method
The timeframe bias will be calculated using a combination of:
1. **Moving Average Relationships** - Comparing short-term vs long-term moving averages
2. **Momentum Indicators** - Using RSI, MACD, and other existing indicators
3. **Price Action Analysis** - Analyzing recent highs/lows and candlestick patterns

### Bias Representation
The bias will be represented as:
- A numerical score from -100 (strongly bearish) to +100 (strongly bullish)
- A categorical label: "strongly_bearish", "bearish", "slightly_bearish", "neutral", "slightly_bullish", "bullish", "strongly_bullish"
- A confidence percentage indicating the strength of the bias signal

### Integration Points
1. **Technical Analysis Module**:
   - Add a new function `calculate_timeframe_bias()` in technical_analysis.py
   - Integrate with `calculate_all_technical_indicators()` function
   - Ensure compatibility with multi-timeframe analysis

2. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Enhance market direction analysis with timeframe bias information
   - Add timeframe bias to the signals list in recommendation output
   - Adjust confidence scores based on alignment of timeframe biases

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the core bias calculation function in technical_analysis.py
2. Add bias results to the technical indicators dataframe
3. Modify the recommendation engine to incorporate bias information
4. Update UI components to display timeframe bias information
5. Add comprehensive testing for the new indicator

## Expected Benefits
1. More accurate trend identification across multiple timeframes
2. Improved recommendation quality by considering timeframe alignment
3. Enhanced context for traders to understand market conditions
4. Better filtering of potential false signals by confirming across timeframes
