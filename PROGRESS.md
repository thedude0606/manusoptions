# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Analyzed repository structure and code
- Identified issues with minute data handling and technical indicator calculations
- Designed solutions for standardizing 60-day minute data pulls and implementing multi-timeframe indicators
- Implemented standardized 60-day minute data pull in fetch_minute_data.py
- Implemented multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations in technical_analysis.py
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes
- Updated `fetch_minute_data.py` to consistently use 60-day data pull from config
- Implemented new `calculate_multi_timeframe_indicators` function in technical_analysis.py
- Added support for 1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, and daily timeframes
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## In Progress
- Testing the multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations
- Updating any dependent code to handle the new multi-timeframe data structure

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Dashboard code may need updates to handle multi-timeframe data
- Need to create comprehensive tests for the new functionality
- Performance optimization for multi-timeframe calculations may be needed

## Next Steps
1. Update any dependent code to handle multi-timeframe data
2. Create tests to validate the changes
3. Update dashboard to support timeframe selection
4. Optimize performance for multi-timeframe calculations
5. Update documentation to reflect the new functionality
