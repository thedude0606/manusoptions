- Fixed Dash obsolete attribute error (app.run_server â†’ app.run)
- Fixed recommendation engine to generate recommendations properly
  - Fixed confidence threshold issue in recommendation engine
  - Fixed underlying price extraction and passing to recommendation engine
- Fixed numpy/pandas binary incompatibility issue by specifying compatible versions
- Added platform-specific installation instructions for Python 3.12 on Apple Silicon (ARM)
- Provided multiple installation options for Python 3.12 on Apple Silicon compatibility
- Fixed options chain table display issues by creating dedicated utility module
- Fixed minute data error handling and display issues

## Current Work in Progress
- Testing dashboard with various symbols and extended data periods
- Validating recommendation engine fixes
- Validating options chain and minute data fixes

## Known Issues or Challenges
- Underlying price was not being properly extracted from options chain API response and passed to the recommendation engine
- Confidence threshold was set too high, filtering out all potential recommendations
- Binary incompatibility between numpy and pandas versions causing application startup failure
- Python 3.12 on Apple Silicon (ARM) requires special handling for numpy/pandas installation
- Numpy 1.24.4 is not directly compatible with Python 3.12 on ARM via conda
- Options chain table was not displaying due to inconsistent data processing
- Minute data errors occurred due to improper error handling

## Next Steps
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Implement data caching to reduce API calls
- Optimize data storage for large datasets
- Add progress visualization during data fetching
- Implement parallel processing for faster data retrieval
