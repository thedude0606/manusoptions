# Progress

## Completed Features or Tasks

- Analyzed Schwab API documentation and example project.
- Set up initial project structure (directories: src, data, docs, tests; files: README.md, src/__init__.py, tests/__init__.py).
- Successfully validated Schwab API client initialization using a placeholder `token.json` file.
- User provided placeholder `token.json` which has been added to the project for development.

## Current Work in Progress

- Preparing for dashboard development: focusing on data retrieval and visualization components.

## Known Issues or Challenges

- Full Schwab API authentication (OAuth flow with browser interaction) will occur when the dashboard application is first run by the user and attempts to make live API calls. The current placeholder token only facilitates initial client setup.

## Next Steps

- Implement fetching of minute-by-minute stock data from the Schwab API for a given symbol, going back 90 days.
- Implement aggregation of minute data into hourly and daily data.
- Implement technical analysis features (Fair value gap, MACD, RSI, Candle patterns).
- Implement options chain data display with periodic updates.
- Develop the user interface for the dashboard.
