# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Analyzed duplicate callback outputs issue in the Dash application
- Identified all callbacks with shared outputs, particularly for error-store.data and options-chain components
- Created TODO list for the refactoring process
- Preparing to refactor callbacks by combining those with shared outputs

## Completed Tasks
- Repository cloned and analyzed
- Identified the following shared outputs causing issues:
  - error-store.data (used in multiple callbacks)
  - options-chain-store.data (used in multiple callbacks)
  - expiration-date-dropdown.options (used in multiple callbacks)
  - expiration-date-dropdown.value (used in multiple callbacks)
  - options-chain-status.children (used in multiple callbacks)

## In Progress
- Refactoring callbacks to combine those with shared outputs
- Implementing dash.callback_context to distinguish triggers in combined callbacks

## Next Steps
- Complete callback refactoring
- Test the application to ensure all functionality is preserved
- Push code changes to GitHub
- Update documentation with architectural decisions
