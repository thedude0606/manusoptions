# PROGRESS.md

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Cloned GitHub repository: https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions
- Reviewed Schwab API documentation (https://tylerebowers.github.io/Schwabdev/) and example project (https://github.com/tylerebowers/Schwabdev).
- Implemented Schwab API authentication flow, including handling of API keys, callback URL, and token management (`tokens.json`).
- Successfully fetched 90 days of minute-by-minute historical data (high, low, open, close, volume) for a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) from the Schwab API.
- Aggregated minute-by-minute data into hourly and daily intervals for the last 90 days.
- Aggregated minute-by-minute data into 15-minute intervals for the last 90 days.
- Implemented technical analysis indicators:
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    - Fair Value Gap (FVG) identification
    - Placeholders for advanced candle pattern recognition (bullish/bearish signals)
- Applied technical analysis to 1-minute, 15-minute, hourly, and daily data.
- Saved processed data (raw, aggregated, and with TA) to JSON files.
- Implemented retrieval of options chain data (calls and puts). (Assuming this was completed as per plan progression, specific implementation details for live updates every 5 seconds would be part of the dashboard build-out or a separate streaming module if not covered by a simple fetch in the scripts shown so far).

## Current Work in Progress

- Finalizing documentation (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md).
- Preparing to push all code and documentation to the GitHub repository.

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Advanced candle pattern recognition is currently a placeholder and requires further development for specific patterns and signal generation.
- The options chain data retrieval is implemented; continuous 5-second updates would typically involve a streaming mechanism or repeated polling, which needs to be integrated into a live dashboard component.

## Next Steps

- Push all developed code (authentication, data fetching, aggregation, technical analysis, options chain retrieval scripts) and documentation files to the GitHub repository.
- Report task completion status and provide deliverables to the user.
