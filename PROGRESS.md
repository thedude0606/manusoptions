# Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Manus Options project.

## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-15)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'schwabdev.streamer_client\'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name \'app\' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   **Reviewed existing project codebase and documentation (DECISIONS.md, TODO.md, PROGRESS.md).**
*   **Analyzed Schwabdev example project and its documentation for API authentication and data streaming best practices.**
*   **Planned next development steps based on review and analysis.**
*   **Created `requirements.txt` file, documenting all Python dependencies for the project.**
*   **Implemented Bollinger Bands (BB) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py`.**
*   **Verified existing Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional.**
*   **Verified existing Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional (supports customizable EMAs and signal line).**
*   **Implemented and validated Intraday Momentum Index (IMI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (supports customizable period).**
*   **Implemented and validated Money Flow Index (MFI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (customizable period, volume-weighted RSI).**
*   **Refactored `technical_analysis.py` to ensure correct function definitions, order, and parameter usage for all TA indicators.**
*   **Generated sample data files (minute, hourly, daily for AAPL) using YahooFinance API to enable local testing of `technical_analysis.py`.**

*(For a detailed list of all completed sub-tasks, please refer to the `TODO.md` file.)*

## Current Work In Progress

*   **Documentation Update:** Finalizing updates to `PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` after recent TA feature completion.
*   **Preparation for Next Development Cycle:** Planning implementation of user customization for TA parameters and Fair Value Gaps (FVG).

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Pandas FutureWarning:** The `technical_analysis.py` script currently shows `FutureWarning` messages from pandas related to dtype compatibility when setting boolean values for FVG. This does not currently block functionality but should be addressed in the future for cleaner execution and to prevent potential issues with future pandas versions.
*   **RSI Customization:** The existing RSI function in `technical_analysis.py` does not currently support customizable overbought/oversold levels directly as parameters. This can be considered for future enhancement.

## Next Steps

1.  **Push all updated documentation files (`PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, `DECISIONS.md`) to the GitHub repository.**
2.  **Notify user of the progress, including the successful implementation and testing of IMI and MFI, and the push of these updates.**
3.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features** as outlined in `TODO.md`, starting with developing a system for users to customize parameters for all indicators and then implementing Fair Value Gaps (FVG) logic.
