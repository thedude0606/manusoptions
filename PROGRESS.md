# Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Manus Options project.

## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-15)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name 'StreamService' from 'schwabdev.stream'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.

## Current Work In Progress

*   **Investigating "Subscription ADD failed for LEVELONE_OPTIONS" error:**
    *   Status: In Progress
    *   Details: This is a persistent error. The next step is to obtain and analyze full logs, including the exact subscription payload being sent to the Schwab API, to understand why the subscription is failing.

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **"Subscription ADD failed for LEVELONE_OPTIONS":** This is the primary blocking issue preventing the streaming of Level One options data.
*   **Historical Data Truncation (Previously Encountered):** While resolved with workarounds for specific files, vigilance is needed if similar issues arise with large log files or source code files during debugging.

## Next Steps

1.  **Resolve "Subscription ADD failed for LEVELONE_OPTIONS" error.** (High Priority)
2.  **Create `requirements.txt` file:** Document all Python dependencies for the project.
3.  **Review and fix remaining dashboard data formatting issues:** Ensure all data (dates, N/A values) is displayed correctly.
4.  **Complete data merging logic in `StreamingManager`:** Ensure robust handling of partial updates to minimize "N/A" values in the UI.
5.  **Begin Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features:**
    *   Start with Core Technical Analysis Engine (Backend & UI), focusing on implementing technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, etc.).
    *   (Refer to `TODO.md` for the detailed breakdown of Phase 2 tasks).
