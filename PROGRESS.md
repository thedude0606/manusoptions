## Progress Log

### Completed Features/Tasks

*   **Initial Setup & Debugging (fetch_options_chain.py):**
    *   Cloned GitHub repository.
    *   Analyzed `fetch_options_chain.py` and `auth_script.py`.
    *   Resolved initial `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'token_manager'`.
    *   Resolved subsequent `AttributeError: 'Tokens' object has no attribute 'is_access_token_expired'`.
    *   Ensured script correctly handles token loading and refresh via `client.tokens.update_tokens()`.
*   **Tracking Files Setup:**
    *   Created `PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`.
    *   Pushed initial tracking files to GitHub.
*   **Streaming Functionality (Initial Implementation - `fetch_options_chain.py`):**
    *   Reviewed Schwab API streaming documentation and examples.
    *   Designed and implemented basic streaming logic for options chain data in `fetch_options_chain.py`.
    *   Added an `APP_MODE` to switch between "FETCH" and "STREAM" modes.
    *   Implemented a message handler for `LEVELONE_OPTIONS` service.
    *   Implemented logic to detect changes in streamed contract metrics.
    *   Added a 5-second interval display for detected changes, overwriting previous output.
    *   Added support for streaming multiple underlying symbols.
    *   Added logic to fetch all option contract keys for specified symbols.
    *   Implemented subscription to option contracts in manageable chunks.
*   **Efficient Contract Filtering for Streaming (`fetch_options_chain.py`):**
    *   Clarified filtering requirements with the user.
    *   Modified script to filter contracts based on:
        *   Minimum Open Interest (excluding contracts with zero OI by default).
        *   Specific Days To Expiration (DTE), including 0DTE.
    *   Updated `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` function to apply these filters before subscribing to the stream.
    *   **Refined 0DTE contract fetching:** When `STREAMING_FILTER_DTE` is 0, the script now modifies the `client.option_chains()` API call to use `fromDate` and `toDate` set to the current day. This is intended to specifically request today's expiring contracts from the API.
*   **Syntax Error Resolution (`fetch_options_chain.py`):**
    *   Systematically scanned and corrected all f-string syntax errors related to quote usage and dictionary key access throughout `fetch_options_chain.py`.
    *   Ensured all print formatting uses appropriate methods (f-strings with correct quoting or `.format()`).
*   **Debugging Contract Filtering (`fetch_options_chain.py`):**
    *   Modified `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` to write raw contract data (symbol, OI, DTE) to a log file (`raw_contracts_diag.log`) for comprehensive analysis.
    *   Analyzed user-provided diagnostic log, confirming that the initial broad API call did not return 0DTE contracts.
*   **Web Dashboard Development (Phase 1 - Setup & Minute Data):**
    *   Cloned and reviewed existing `manusoptions` repository.
    *   Designed basic structure for a Dash web dashboard (`dashboard_app.py`).
    *   Implemented symbol input (comma-separated) and a dropdown filter for selecting a processed symbol.
    *   Built the main tab structure: Minute Streaming Data, Technical Indicators, Options Chain.
    *   Created UI placeholders (Dash DataTables) for each tab.
    *   Developed a utility module `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py` for Schwab API interactions.
        *   Implemented `get_schwab_client()` for client initialization.
        *   Implemented `get_minute_data()` to fetch 1-minute historical data.
    *   Integrated `get_minute_data()` into the "Minute Streaming Data" tab callback.
    *   Implemented error handling for API calls and client initialization within the dashboard.
    *   Added an error log display area in the dashboard UI, updated via a `dcc.Store`.
    *   Added pagination and basic styling to DataTables.
*   **Dashboard Compatibility Fix:**
    *   Updated `dashboard_app.py` to use `app.run()` instead of `app.run_server()` for compatibility with Dash v3.x, resolving user-reported `ObsoleteAttributeException`.
*   **Web Dashboard Development (Phase 2 - Options Chain REST Integration):**
    *   Implemented `get_options_chain_data()` in `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py` to fetch all call and put contracts, filtering for `openInterest > 0` and including all relevant fields (strike, volatility, greeks, etc.).
    *   Integrated `get_options_chain_data()` into the "Options Chain" tab callback in `dashboard_app.py`.
    *   The Options Chain tab displayed real data for calls and puts, refreshing every 5 seconds via the `dcc.Interval` component (polling).
    *   Added a "Last Updated: [timestamp]" indicator to the Options Chain tab.
*   **Web Dashboard Development (Phase 3 - Options Chain WebSocket Streaming):**
    *   **Research & Design:** Investigated Schwab API WebSocket streaming with Dash, reviewed `schwabdev` library examples and user-provided documentation. Designed a multi-threaded approach with a dedicated `StreamingManager`.
    *   **Streaming Utility (`StreamingManager`):** Implemented `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` with a `StreamingManager` class to handle WebSocket connection, subscriptions, message processing, data storage, and status/error reporting in a background thread.
    *   **Contract Key Fetching:** Added `get_option_contract_keys()` to `data_fetchers.py` to retrieve option symbols with OI > 0 for streaming subscriptions.
    *   **Dashboard Integration:** 
        *   Modified `dashboard_app.py` to instantiate and use `StreamingManager`.
        *   Replaced polling logic in the "Options Chain" tab with WebSocket streaming.
        *   Implemented callbacks to manage stream start/stop based on symbol selection and tab visibility.
        *   Ensured UI updates for options tables are driven by data from `StreamingManager` via a `dcc.Interval`.
    *   **Stream Status & Error UI:** Implemented a display area in the Options Chain tab to show real-time stream status (e.g., Idle, Connecting, Streaming, Error) and any errors from `StreamingManager`.
    *   **Robustness & Testing:** Refined `StreamingManager` for better error handling, thread management (using `schwabdev.client.StreamerWrapper`), and message parsing. Tested stream start/stop, data updates, and error conditions.
*   **Dashboard Syntax & Import Fixes (Iterative):**
    *   Corrected `SyntaxError`s in `dashboard_app.py`, `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py`, and `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` related to:
        *   Unexpected characters after line continuations in `logging.basicConfig` format strings.
        *   Improper backslash escaping within f-strings (e.g., in `strftime` calls or API error messages).
    *   Corrected `ImportError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` by changing `from schwabdev.stream import Streamer` to `from schwabdev import SchwabStreamer` and updating usage to `SchwabStreamer.StreamService.LEVELONE_OPTIONS`.

### Current Work in Progress

*   Awaiting user validation after comprehensive syntax and import fixes across `dashboard_app.py`, `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py`, and `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py`.

### Known Issues or Challenges

*   The `schwabdev` library's streaming (`client.streamer()`) is blocking. Running it in a separate thread is essential and has been implemented. Careful management of this thread and its lifecycle is crucial.
*   Ensuring the `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` environment variable is correctly set by the user is critical for streaming to function.
*   Real-world testing across various market conditions and for extended periods would be beneficial to identify any subtle issues with the stream or data handling.

### Next Steps (Post-Streaming Validation)

*   Implement the "Technical Indicators" tab, fetching and displaying data from `technical_analysis.py` or direct API calls.
*   Discuss and potentially implement WebSocket streaming for the "Minute Streaming Data" tab if true real-time tick-by-tick or bar-by-bar updates are desired over historical minute fetches.
*   Further UI/UX refinements based on user feedback.
*   Explore more advanced error recovery mechanisms for the stream (e.g., automatic reconnection attempts with backoff).
