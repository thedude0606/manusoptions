# Progress Report

## May 20, 2025

### Completed
- Fixed issue with blank last, bid, and ask fields in the options chain tab
  - Identified that the backend was fetching these fields but they were sometimes missing or null
  - Initially modified `get_options_chain_data()` to ensure fields were present but incorrectly defaulted values to 0
  - Updated fix to preserve actual API values and only use defaults when fields are truly missing
  - Added validation to ensure the DataFrame always contains these columns

### In Progress
- Pushing code changes to main branch
- Validating the fix in the web application

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Next Steps
- Update documentation files (TODO.md and DECISIONS.md)
- Continue monitoring for any other UI display issues
