- Properly imported existing functions (normalize_contract_key, split_options_by_type) from their respective modules

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes
- Updated `fetch_minute_data.py` to consistently use 60-day data pull from config
- Implemented new `calculate_multi_timeframe_indicators` function in technical_analysis.py
- Added support for 1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, and daily timeframes
- Modified `get_minute_data` in data_fetchers.py to always use 60 days without any dropdown options
- Refactored `get_technical_indicators` to return a single table with a timeframe column
- Updated dashboard_app.py to handle the new data structure
- Fixed options chain tab by replacing incorrect `get_option_chain` method with the correct `option_chains` method in the Schwab API client
- Fixed options generations (Recommendations) tab by adding missing selected-symbol-store and update interval
- Enhanced technical indicators store to include timeframe_data structure for Recommendations tab
- Updated documentation to reflect all fixes and architectural changes
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository
- Investigated options chain update issue and found that StreamingManager is not integrated with dashboard_app.py
- Created dashboard_app_streaming.py with StreamingManager integration for real-time updates
- Modified streaming toggle to be enabled by default per user request
- Created StreamingFieldMapper module to provide comprehensive mapping between streaming data fields and DataFrame columns
- Fixed options chain UI update issue by implementing dynamic field mapping in update_options_tables callback
- Enhanced logging to track which fields are being updated from streaming data
- Implemented contract key normalization in the update_options_tables callback to ensure proper matching between streaming data and DataFrame rows
- Added additional pattern matching to contract_utils.py to handle Schwab streaming format with spaces
- Implemented state preservation mechanism to prevent options chain from disappearing
- Added last-valid-options-store to maintain state between streaming updates
- Enhanced streaming data update callback with validity checks
- Improved error handling in options table update callback
- Added fallback mechanisms to ensure options chain remains visible
- Fixed options chain tab not showing any data by implementing ensure_putcall_field function
- Enhanced split_options_by_type to properly handle both API-fetched and streaming-updated data

- Improved state preservation with last-valid-options-store in both dashboard_app.py and dashboard_app_streaming.py
- Added detailed logging to track options chain data flow and troubleshoot issues
- Fixed Recommendations tab button not working by adding it as an Input to the update_recommendations callback
- Added additional logging to track button click events in the recommendations generation process
- Enhanced the update_recommendations callback to explicitly handle button click events
