# Project Progress

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Initial project setup with Dash framework
- Authentication with Schwab API
- Basic dashboard layout with tabs
- Minute data fetching and display
- Technical indicator calculation and display
- Options chain data fetching via REST API
- Streaming infrastructure for real-time options data
- Enhanced logging system with separate log files for different components
- Raw stream message logging for debugging purposes
- Fixed streaming data handling to properly process and display Last, Bid, Ask values

## Current Work in Progress

- Debugging and enhancing options streaming functionality
- Improving error handling and reporting
- Optimizing data refresh rates and performance
- Implementing additional technical indicators

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Last, Bid, Ask values not showing up in options streaming tab (FIXED)
  - Root cause: Insufficient logging of raw stream messages and incomplete message parsing
  - Solution: Enhanced logging of raw stream messages and improved parsing logic
- Logging system not creating expected log files (FIXED)
  - Root cause: Log directory not being created automatically
  - Solution: Added explicit directory creation with os.makedirs()
- Stream subscription management needs optimization for large option chains
- Performance issues with large datasets in the dashboard

## Next Steps

- Implement additional filtering options for options chain display
- Add visualization components for technical indicators
- Enhance error reporting in the UI
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add user preferences for dashboard customization
- Optimize streaming data updates to reduce UI lag
- Implement automated testing for critical components
