# Progress Report

## May 27, 2025

### Completed Tasks

- Reviewed repository structure and identified all tabs in the dashboard
- Analyzed data sources for each tab (Minute Data, Technical Indicators, Options Chain, Recommendations)
- Designed Excel export functionality for each tab
- Created utility module for Excel export (`dashboard_utils/excel_export.py`)
- Created download component for handling file downloads in Dash (`dashboard_utils/download_component.py`)
- Created export button components and callbacks (`dashboard_utils/export_buttons.py`)
- Integrated export buttons and download components into dashboard layout
- Updated main dashboard application with export functionality

### Current Work in Progress

- Pushing code changes to GitHub repository
- Updating documentation files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Validating export functionality in the running application

### Technical Details

#### Excel Export Implementation

The Excel export functionality has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Excel Export Utility (`dashboard_utils/excel_export.py`)**:
   - Functions to export data from each tab to Excel files
   - Handles all data types: minute data, technical indicators, options chain, recommendations
   - Includes metadata in each Excel file for traceability
   - Organizes data into multiple sheets for better readability

2. **Download Component (`dashboard_utils/download_component.py`)**:
   - Custom Dash component for handling file downloads
   - Uses base64 encoding for file content
   - Automatically triggers download when data is available

3. **Export Buttons (`dashboard_utils/export_buttons.py`)**:
   - Creates styled export buttons for each tab
   - Registers callbacks to handle export requests
   - Connects button clicks to export functions

4. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added export buttons to each tab
   - Connected download components
   - Registered all necessary callbacks

#### Data Handling

- Export functionality captures all data from the respective dcc.Store components, not just the visible or paginated data
- Each export includes metadata about the data source, timestamp, and symbol
- Technical indicators are organized by timeframe in separate sheets
- Options chain data is split into calls and puts, with additional sheets for each expiration date

### Known Issues or Challenges

- Need to validate export functionality with large datasets
- Need to ensure proper error handling for all edge cases
- Need to test with various browsers to ensure download functionality works consistently
- ~~Duplicate callback outputs errors for download links~~ (Fixed on May 27, 2025)

### Next Steps

- Complete validation of export functionality
- Add additional error handling if needed
- Consider adding progress indicators for large exports
- Update styling to ensure export buttons are consistently positioned
