# Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Manus Options project.

## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-15)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'schwabdev.streamer_client\'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name \'app\' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   **Reviewed existing project codebase and documentation (DECISIONS.md, TODO.md, PROGRESS.md).**
*   **Analyzed Schwabdev example project and its documentation for API authentication and data streaming best practices.**
*   **Planned next development steps based on review and analysis.**
*   **Created `requirements.txt` file, documenting all Python dependencies for the project.**
*   **Implemented Bollinger Bands (BB) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py`.**
*   **Verified existing Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional.**

*(For a detailed list of all completed sub-tasks, please refer to the `TODO.md` file.)*

## Current Work In Progress

*   **Documentation Update:** Finalizing updates to `PROGRESS.md` and `TODO.md` after recent development and verification.
*   **Preparation for Next Development Cycle:** Planning implementation of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Historical Data Truncation (Previously Encountered):** While resolved with workarounds for specific files, vigilance is needed if similar issues arise with large log files or source code files during debugging.
*   **RSI Customization:** The existing RSI function in `technical_analysis.py` does not currently support customizable overbought/oversold levels directly as parameters. This can be considered for future enhancement.

## Next Steps

1.  **Push all updated documentation files (`PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`) to the GitHub repository.**
2.  **Notify user of the progress, including the verification of RSI, and the push of these updates.**
3.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features** as outlined in `TODO.md`, starting with the implementation of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) calculation logic.
