# PROGRESS.md

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Cloned the GitHub repository `thedude0606/manusoptions`.
- Investigated the error: `calculate_all_technical_indicators() got an unexpected keyword argument 'period_name'`.
- Identified the cause of the `period_name` argument error in `dashboard_app.py`.
- Fixed the `calculate_all_technical_indicators()` error by correcting the arguments in `dashboard_app.py` (removed `period_name` and updated `symbol` argument to include period information).
- Pushed initial fix and tracking files to GitHub.
- Investigated new error: `MinData-Format-SPY: Index is not DatetimeIndex after fetch.`
- Identified the cause of the `DatetimeIndex` error in `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py` (timestamp column was converted to string and named 'Timestamp' instead of 'timestamp').
- Fixed the `DatetimeIndex` error by ensuring the 'timestamp' column in `data_fetchers.py` remains a datetime object and is named 'timestamp' for consistency with `dashboard_app.py`.
- Investigated new error: `The truth value of a Series is ambiguous` in RSI calculation.
- Identified the cause of the Series truth value error in `technical_analysis.py` (improper handling of pandas Series in a conditional expression).
- Fixed the Series truth value error by using nested `np.where` calls to properly handle Series objects in the RSI calculation.
- Fixed the technical indicator tab issues with N/A and strange values by ensuring proper handling of Series objects in conditional expressions and maintaining consistent column naming.
- Updated all documentation files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md) to reflect the changes and rationale.
- Pushed all changes to GitHub.
