# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Analyzed repository structure and code
- Identified issues with minute data handling and technical indicator calculations
- Designed solutions for standardizing 60-day minute data pulls and implementing multi-timeframe indicators
- Implemented standardized 60-day minute data pull in fetch_minute_data.py
- Implemented multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations in technical_analysis.py
- Updated dashboard to hardcode 60-day minute data pull and display all timeframe indicators in a single table
- Fixed options chain tab error by correcting the Schwab API method name
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes
- Updated `fetch_minute_data.py` to consistently use 60-day data pull from config
- Implemented new `calculate_multi_timeframe_indicators` function in technical_analysis.py
- Added support for 1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, and daily timeframes
- Modified `get_minute_data` in data_fetchers.py to always use 60 days without any dropdown options
- Refactored `get_technical_indicators` to return a single table with a timeframe column
- Updated dashboard_app.py to handle the new data structure
- Fixed options chain tab by replacing incorrect `get_option_chain` method with the correct `option_chains` method in the Schwab API client
- Updated documentation to reflect the options chain fix
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## In Progress
- Validating dashboard functionality and data accuracy

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to ensure the dashboard correctly displays all timeframes in a single table
- Performance optimization for multi-timeframe calculations may be needed
- Resolved: Options chain tab was failing due to incorrect API method name

## Next Steps
1. Validate that the dashboard correctly displays all technical indicator timeframes
2. Verify that the options chain tab now works correctly with the API method fix
3. Create tests to validate the changes
4. Optimize performance for multi-timeframe calculations if needed
5. Continue updating documentation to reflect the new functionality
