# Progress Report

## May 19, 2025

### Completed
- Analyzed current data flow and codebase structure
- Identified inefficiencies in the current implementation:
  - Full 90-day history fetched on every symbol change or tab switch
  - No caching mechanism for previously fetched data
  - Redundant API calls and processing overhead
- Designed comprehensive incremental update strategy
- Created detailed documentation of design decisions
- Updated TODO list with prioritized implementation tasks
- Implemented global data cache structure (MINUTE_DATA_CACHE)
- Enhanced get_minute_data function to properly utilize since_timestamp parameter
- Implemented data merging logic for incremental updates
- Added periodic update mechanism with 30-second interval
- Implemented selective technical indicator recalculation
- Added loading indicators for initial data fetch
- Implemented robust error handling for failed updates

### Known Issues/Challenges
- Cache memory usage could be optimized further for applications with many symbols
- Edge cases in market data (e.g., trading halts, gaps) might require additional handling
- WebSocket streaming could be considered for future enhancement instead of polling

### Next Steps
- Push all code changes to GitHub repository
- Consider future enhancements:
  - Optimize cache memory usage with LRU eviction policy
  - Add configuration options for update frequency
  - Implement analytics to track API call reduction
  - Evaluate WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
