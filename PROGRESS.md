# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Analyzed repository structure and code
- Identified issues with minute data handling and technical indicator calculations
- Designed solutions for standardizing 60-day minute data pulls and implementing multi-timeframe indicators
- Implemented standardized 60-day minute data pull in fetch_minute_data.py
- Implemented multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations in technical_analysis.py
- Updated dashboard to hardcode 60-day minute data pull and display all timeframe indicators in a single table
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes
- Updated `fetch_minute_data.py` to consistently use 60-day data pull from config
- Implemented new `calculate_multi_timeframe_indicators` function in technical_analysis.py
- Added support for 1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, and daily timeframes
- Modified `get_minute_data` in data_fetchers.py to always use 60 days without any dropdown options
- Refactored `get_technical_indicators` to return a single table with a timeframe column
- Updated dashboard_app.py to handle the new data structure
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## In Progress
- Validating dashboard functionality and data accuracy

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to ensure the dashboard correctly displays all timeframes in a single table
- Performance optimization for multi-timeframe calculations may be needed

## Next Steps
1. Validate that the dashboard correctly displays all technical indicator timeframes
2. Create tests to validate the changes
3. Optimize performance for multi-timeframe calculations if needed
4. Update documentation to reflect the new functionality
