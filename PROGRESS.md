## Progress Log

### Completed Features or Tasks

*   Cloned GitHub repository: `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions` on 2025-05-14.
*   Analyzed `fetch_options_chain.py` and `auth_script.py` to understand current implementation on 2025-05-14.
*   Reviewed `schwabdev` library usage based on provided example and code structure on 2025-05-14.
*   Created initial `PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` files and pushed to GitHub on 2025-05-14.
*   **Resolved `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'token_manager'` in `fetch_options_chain.py` by correcting token handling logic to use `client.tokens` methods on 2025-05-14.**
*   Installed necessary Python dependencies (`schwabdev`, `python-dotenv`) in the development environment on 2025-05-14.

### Current Work in Progress

*   Preparing to push the corrected `fetch_options_chain.py` script and updated tracking files to GitHub.
*   Awaiting user to provide a valid `.env` file or confirm its setup in their environment for full end-to-end testing of `fetch_options_chain.py` (specifically, the actual data fetching part which requires valid credentials and tokens).

### Known Issues or Challenges

*   The `fetch_options_chain.py` script currently exits if the `.env` file is not found or is missing required API keys. This is expected behavior. Full testing of the options chain data fetching requires a valid `.env` file with `APP_KEY`, `APP_SECRET`, `CALLBACK_URL`, and a valid `tokens.json` file (or the ability to generate one via `auth_script.py` and user authentication).

### Next Steps

*   Push the corrected `fetch_options_chain.py` and updated tracking files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md) to the user's GitHub repository.
*   Notify the user about the fix for the `AttributeError` and the successful script execution up to the point of credential/token validation.
*   Request the user to set up their `.env` file and `tokens.json` (by running `auth_script.py` and authenticating) in their local environment to test the full data fetching functionality.
*   If the user wishes for me to test the data fetching, they will need to provide the callback URL after they authenticate, so I can obtain a token.
