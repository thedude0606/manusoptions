# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Analyzed repository structure and code
- Identified issues with minute data handling and technical indicator calculations
- Designed solutions for standardizing 60-day minute data pulls and implementing multi-timeframe indicators
- Implemented standardized 60-day minute data pull in fetch_minute_data.py
- Implemented multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations in technical_analysis.py
- Updated dashboard to hardcode 60-day minute data pull and display all timeframe indicators in a single table
- Fixed options chain tab error by correcting the Schwab API method name
- Fixed options generations (Recommendations) tab by adding missing selected-symbol-store
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository
- Identified issue with options chain not updating in real-time: StreamingManager exists but is not integrated with dashboard_app.py
- Integrated StreamingManager into dashboard_app_streaming.py for real-time options chain updates
- Set real-time updates to be enabled by default as requested by user
- Verified streaming interval component is correctly set to disabled=False by default
- Confirmed toggle callback correctly enables/disables the interval
- Verified debug logging is present throughout the streaming data flow
- Identified that streaming functionality is still not working despite correct configuration
- Found that logs directory was missing, suggesting StreamingManager may not be initializing properly
- Created logs directory to enable proper logging for troubleshooting
- Identified and fixed mapping issue between streaming data contract keys and options table data
- Implemented robust StreamingFieldMapper to dynamically map all streamer fields to DataFrame columns
- Integrated StreamingFieldMapper into dashboard_app_streaming.py for comprehensive real-time updates
- Identified and fixed contract key normalization mismatch between streaming data and DataFrame rows
- Enhanced contract key normalization to handle additional format patterns, including Schwab streaming format with spaces
- Fixed issue where options chain would disappear after a few seconds by implementing state preservation and defensive checks
- Identified and fixed issue with options chain tab not showing any data due to missing putCall field mapping
- Implemented robust ensure_putcall_field function to handle both API-fetched and streaming-updated data
- Enhanced state preservation mechanism to maintain options chain data consistency across user interactions

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes
- Updated `fetch_minute_data.py` to consistently use 60-day data pull from config
- Implemented new `calculate_multi_timeframe_indicators` function in technical_analysis.py
- Added support for 1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, and daily timeframes
- Modified `get_minute_data` in data_fetchers.py to always use 60 days without any dropdown options
- Refactored `get_technical_indicators` to return a single table with a timeframe column
- Updated dashboard_app.py to handle the new data structure
- Fixed options chain tab by replacing incorrect `get_option_chain` method with the correct `option_chains` method in the Schwab API client
- Fixed options generations (Recommendations) tab by adding missing selected-symbol-store and update interval
- Enhanced technical indicators store to include timeframe_data structure for Recommendations tab
- Updated documentation to reflect all fixes and architectural changes
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository
- Investigated options chain update issue and found that StreamingManager is not integrated with dashboard_app.py
- Created dashboard_app_streaming.py with StreamingManager integration for real-time updates
- Modified streaming toggle to be enabled by default per user request
- Created StreamingFieldMapper module to provide comprehensive mapping between streaming data fields and DataFrame columns
- Fixed options chain UI update issue by implementing dynamic field mapping in update_options_tables callback
- Enhanced logging to track which fields are being updated from streaming data
- Implemented contract key normalization in the update_options_tables callback to ensure proper matching between streaming data and DataFrame rows
- Added additional pattern matching to contract_utils.py to handle Schwab streaming format with spaces
- Implemented state preservation mechanism to prevent options chain from disappearing
- Added last-valid-options-store to maintain state between streaming updates
- Enhanced streaming data update callback with validity checks
- Improved error handling in options table update callback
- Added fallback mechanisms to ensure options chain remains visible
- Fixed options chain tab not showing any data by implementing ensure_putcall_field function
- Enhanced split_options_by_type to properly handle both API-fetched and streaming-updated data
- Added proper field mapping from contractType (C/P) to putCall (CALL/PUT)
- Improved state preservation with last-valid-options-store in both dashboard_app.py and dashboard_app_streaming.py
- Added detailed logging to track options chain data flow and troubleshoot issues

## In Progress
- Testing real-time updates with various symbols
- Optimizing streaming performance and error handling
- Validating that all streamer fields are correctly mapped to the options table

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to ensure the dashboard correctly displays all timeframes in a single table
- Performance optimization for multi-timeframe calculations may be needed
- Resolved: Options chain tab was failing due to incorrect API method name
- Resolved: Options generations (Recommendations) tab was failing due to missing selected-symbol-store
- Resolved: Options chain not updating in real-time due to missing StreamingManager integration
- Resolved: Real-time updates now enabled by default per user request
- Resolved: Options chain UI not updating due to incomplete mapping between streaming data contract keys and options table data
- Resolved: Contract key normalization mismatch between streaming data and DataFrame rows
- Resolved: Added support for additional contract key formats to improve normalization robustness
- Resolved: Options chain disappearing after a few seconds due to state management issues with streaming updates
- Resolved: Options chain tab not showing any data due to missing putCall field mapping from streaming data

## Next Steps
1. Test real-time updates with various symbols
2. Create tests to validate the changes
3. Optimize performance for multi-timeframe calculations if needed
4. Continue updating documentation to reflect the new functionality
5. Consider adding visual indicators for fields that have been updated via streaming data
6. Implement caching for normalized contract keys to improve performance
7. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms for streaming data
8. Consider implementing more robust fallback strategies for different data scenarios
