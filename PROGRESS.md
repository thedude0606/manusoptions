# PROGRESS

This document outlines the progress made on the Manus Options project, detailing completed tasks, ongoing work, identified challenges, and the next steps in development.

## Current Status and Achievements

Work commenced by cloning the specified GitHub repository, `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions`, to establish a local development environment. The primary initial task was to address a critical `ModuleNotFoundError` related to `schwabdev.streamer_client`, which prevented the `dashboard_app.py` application from running. The investigation revealed that the project lacked a standard Python dependency management file, such as `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.

Following this, research was conducted using the provided example repository (`https://github.com/tylerebowers/Schwabdev`) and its associated documentation (`https://tylerebowers.github.io/Schwabdev/`). This research confirmed that the `schwabdev` library was the correct dependency for interacting with the Schwab API. The `schwabdev` package was subsequently installed using `pip3`. During the validation phase, further `ModuleNotFoundError`s emerged for other packages, specifically `dash` and `python-dotenv`. These dependencies were also installed iteratively to allow the application to proceed with its import sequence.

A significant finding during this process was that the original import `from schwabdev.streamer_client import StreamerClient` was no longer valid. The `schwabdev` library had undergone changes, and the `StreamerClient` class or `streamer_client` module was either deprecated or restructured. The current method for accessing streaming functionality, as indicated by the library\'s documentation, is through the `client.stream` attribute of an authenticated `schwabdev.Client` instance.

Consequently, a key architectural update was performed. The `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` file was refactored to align with this new API. This involved removing the direct import of `StreamerClient` and modifying the `StreamingManager` class to initialize and utilize the streamer via `schwab_api_client.stream`. The import for `StreamService` was initially attempted as `from schwabdev.stream import StreamService`, and the `account_id` was passed to the `stream_client.start()` method. After these modifications, `dashboard_app.py` was executed again, and it successfully started the Dash server without the initial import errors.

Subsequent user feedback highlighted two new runtime issues: a message indicating `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH not set in .env` and an `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'`. These issues were investigated. The `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` issue was traced to the absence of a `.env` file in the project root. A `.env` file was created with a placeholder value for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` to allow the application to load this necessary configuration. It was noted that users would need to populate this with their actual account hash.

The `StreamService` import error confirmed that the previous assumption about its availability was incorrect. Further review of the `schwabdev` library\'s `stream.py` source code and its usage patterns (e.g., methods like `add_levelone_option_subscription`) indicated that service-specific subscription methods should be used instead of a generic `StreamService` enum passed to the `start` method. The `streaming_manager.py` was refactored again to remove the `StreamService` import and instead use `self.stream_client.add_levelone_option_subscription(keys=keys_list, fields=fields_to_request_list)` to subscribe to level one options data. The `stream_client.start(handler=self._handle_stream_message)` method was then called without the `service`, `symbols`, `fields`, or `account_id` parameters, as these are managed by the subscription methods and the client instance itself.

Further investigation into the `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` requirement, prompted by user feedback and review of `schwabdev` documentation (including `stream_demo.py`), revealed that the account hash is **not** strictly necessary for general market data streaming (e.g., `LEVELONE_OPTIONS`). It is primarily required for account-specific streams like `ACCT_ACTIVITY`. Both `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` and `dashboard_app.py` were updated to reflect this. The `streaming_manager` now logs the presence of an account hash but does not fail if it\'s absent for market data streams. `dashboard_app.py` no longer treats a missing `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` as a blocking error at startup for market data streaming use cases.

## Completed Features or Tasks

- Successfully cloned the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions`.
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'schwabdev.streamer_client\'`.
- Identified the absence of a formal dependency management file and determined the necessary dependencies through iterative testing and documentation review.
- Installed required Python packages: `schwabdev`, `dash`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Researched and understood the updated streaming API for the `schwabdev` library.
- Initially refactored `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` to use `client.stream`.
- Addressed the `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH not set in .env` error by creating a `.env` file and highlighting the need for user configuration.
- Resolved the `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'` by further refactoring `streaming_manager.py` to use service-specific subscription methods (e.g., `add_levelone_option_subscription`) instead of a `StreamService` enum.
- Investigated and clarified the requirement for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` for streaming.
- Updated `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` and `dashboard_app.py` to make `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` optional for market data streaming (e.g., `LEVELONE_OPTIONS`), only requiring it for account-specific streams.
- Validated that `dashboard_app.py` now starts without the previously reported import or environment variable errors, and correctly handles the optional nature of `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` for market data.
- Updated `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` iteratively to reflect the progress and architectural changes.

## Known Issues or Challenges

- A `requirements.txt` file is still needed to formalize dependency management for the project. This should be generated as a next step.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve comprehensively updating the `DECISIONS.md` and `TODO.md` files to document the latest architectural changes related to `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` handling. Following this, all updated code and documentation files (`streaming_manager.py`, `dashboard_app.py`, `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`) will be committed to the local Git repository. These changes will then be pushed to the user\'s GitHub repository. Finally, a status report will be provided to the user, summarizing the actions taken and the current state of the project. Future work will include generating a `requirements.txt` file and addressing any further enhancements or issues as requested by the user.
