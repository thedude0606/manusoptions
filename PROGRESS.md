# Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Manus Options project.

## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-16)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'schwabdev.streamer_client\'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name \'app\' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Reviewed existing project codebase and documentation (DECISIONS.md, TODO.md, PROGRESS.md).
*   Analyzed Schwabdev example project and its documentation for API authentication and data streaming best practices.
*   Planned next development steps based on review and analysis.
*   Created `requirements.txt` file, documenting all Python dependencies for the project.
*   Implemented Bollinger Bands (BB) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py`.
*   Verified existing Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional.
*   Verified existing Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional (supports customizable EMAs and signal line).
*   Implemented and validated Intraday Momentum Index (IMI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (supports customizable period).
*   Implemented and validated Money Flow Index (MFI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (customizable period, volume-weighted RSI).
*   **Refactored `technical_analysis.py`:** (Completed)
    *   Modified TA calculation functions (BB, RSI, MACD, IMI, MFI, FVG) to accept a Pandas DataFrame and symbol as input.
    *   Ensured functions return DataFrames with new indicator columns.
    *   Removed AAPL-specific hardcoding and file I/O dependencies for dashboard integration.
    *   Created a helper function `calculate_all_technical_indicators` to apply all indicators to a given DataFrame.
    *   Implemented a generic `aggregate_candles` function for resampling timeframes.
*   **Integrated Technical Analysis into `dashboard_app.py`:** (Completed)
    *   In `update_tech_indicators_tab` callback, implemented fetching of minute data for the selected symbol.
    *   Implemented logic to aggregate minute data into 1-minute, 15-minute, hourly, and daily DataFrames using `aggregate_candles`.
    *   Called refactored TA functions from `technical_analysis.py` for each aggregated DataFrame.
    *   Handled cases with insufficient data (TA functions return NaNs, UI displays "N/A").
    *   Structured calculated TA values (latest values) for display in `dash_table.DataTable`.
    *   Updated `tech-indicators-table` to display real data, replacing dummy data, with columns: "Indicator", "1min", "15min", "Hourly", "Daily".
*   **Fixed `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_app.py` (f-string quotes):** (Completed)
    *   Corrected nested quote usage in f-strings for 'Implied Volatility', 'Delta', 'Gamma', 'Theta', and 'Vega' fields in the `update_options_chain_stream_data` callback, resolving a user-reported syntax error.
*   **Updated Documentation Files:** (Completed for this phase)
    *   `DECISIONS.md`: Documented architectural choices for TA integration and syntax error fix.
    *   `PROGRESS.md`: Updated to reflect current status.
    *   `TODO.md`: Updated task statuses.

*(For a detailed list of all completed sub-tasks, please refer to the `TODO.md` file.)*

## Current Work In Progress

*   Preparing for the next phase of development (e.g., user customization of TA parameters, FVG display enhancements, addressing known issues).

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Pandas FutureWarning:** The `technical_analysis.py` script currently shows `FutureWarning` messages from pandas related to dtype compatibility when setting boolean values for FVG. This does not currently block functionality but should be addressed in the future for cleaner execution and to prevent potential issues with future pandas versions.
*   **RSI Customization:** The existing RSI function in `technical_analysis.py` does not currently support customizable overbought/oversold levels directly as parameters. This can be considered for future enhancement.
*   **FVG Display:** Fair Value Gaps (FVG) currently produce multiple columns (`fvg_bullish_top`, `fvg_bullish_bottom`, etc.) in the backend. The UI table shows "N/A" for FVG as a simple representation of the latest FVG status (e.g., if the last candle confirmed one) is not yet implemented in the table formatting logic. This requires further design for effective UI display.
*   **Error Display in UI:** While errors are logged and some are passed to the `error-message-store`, the display and granularity of errors related to TA calculation in the UI could be improved.

## Next Steps

1.  **Push all updated code and documentation files (`PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `technical_analysis.py`, `dashboard_app.py`) to the GitHub repository.**
2.  **Notify user of the progress, including the successful integration of technical analysis into the dashboard, the fix for the reported syntax error, and the push of these updates.**
3.  **Address known issues, particularly FVG display and enhanced error handling in the UI.**
4.  **Begin work on user customization for TA parameters.**
5.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features** as outlined in `TODO.md` (if applicable after addressing immediate enhancements).
