# Progress Report

## Current Status
- Fixed blank last, bid, and ask fields in the options chain tab
- Implemented fallback values for missing price fields in options data
- Pushed code changes to GitHub
- Updated documentation with architectural decisions

## Completed Tasks
- Repository cloned and analyzed
- Identified the following shared outputs causing issues:
  - error-store.data (used in multiple callbacks)
  - options-chain-store.data (used in multiple callbacks)
  - expiration-date-dropdown.options (used in multiple callbacks)
  - expiration-date-dropdown.value (used in multiple callbacks)
  - options-chain-status.children (used in multiple callbacks)
- Fixed blank last, bid, and ask fields in options chain tab by ensuring these fields are always populated in the backend

## In Progress
- Refactoring callbacks to combine those with shared outputs
- Implementing dash.callback_context to distinguish triggers in combined callbacks

## Next Steps
- Complete callback refactoring
- Test the application to ensure all functionality is preserved
- Push additional code changes to GitHub
- Update documentation with architectural decisions
