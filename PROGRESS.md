# Progress Report

## May 28, 2025
- Fixed missing market direction components in Dash callbacks
  - Identified root cause: Callbacks in recommendation_tab.py reference several market direction components ('market-direction-text', 'bullish-score', 'bearish-score', 'market-signals') that were missing in the main layout
  - Added all missing components to the market direction section in dashboard_app_updated_fixed.py
  - Implemented comprehensive fix to ensure layout-callback consistency
  - Verified fix by running the application and confirming no callback errors
  - Installed all required dependencies from requirements.txt to ensure proper testing environment

- Investigating export button not working in Safari browser
  - Identified issue: Current implementation uses data URI with base64 encoding which has compatibility issues with Safari
  - Planning to replace custom download component with Dash's native dcc.Download component for better cross-browser compatibility
  - Implementing fix for export functionality to work properly in Safari

- Fixed missing 'recommendation-timeframe-dropdown' component error in Dash callbacks
