# Progress Report

## Completed Features

- Initial project setup
- Authentication with Schwab API
- Basic minute data retrieval (1 day)
- Options chain retrieval
- Dashboard application setup
- Technical analysis implementation
- Recommendation engine implementation
- Batched minute data retrieval for 60 days
- Dashboard integration with 60-day minute data retrieval
- Fixed Dash obsolete attribute error (replaced app.run_server with app.run)
- Fixed recommendations tab with robust data validation and field handling

## Current Work in Progress

- Testing and optimizing the 60-day minute data retrieval in the dashboard
- Enhancing error handling for multi-day data retrieval

## Known Issues or Challenges

- Schwab API limitation: Only returns 1 day of minute data per request
- Need to handle potential rate limiting when making multiple API requests
- Need to ensure proper error handling for days with no market data
- Large datasets may impact dashboard performance

## Next Steps

- Enhance error handling and retry logic for API requests
- Add progress visualization during data fetching
- Optimize data storage and retrieval for large datasets
- Consider adding caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- Implement parallel processing for faster data retrieval
