# Project Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Manus Options project.

## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-16)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'schwabdev.streamer_client\'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name \'StreamService\' from \'schwabdev.stream\'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name \'app\' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Reviewed existing project codebase and documentation (DECISIONS.md, TODO.md, PROGRESS.md).
*   Analyzed Schwabdev example project and its documentation for API authentication and data streaming best practices.
*   Planned next development steps based on review and analysis.
*   Created `requirements.txt` file, documenting all Python dependencies for the project.
*   Implemented Bollinger Bands (BB) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py`.
*   Verified existing Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional.
*   Verified existing Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` as complete and functional (supports customizable EMAs and signal line).
*   Implemented and validated Intraday Momentum Index (IMI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (supports customizable period).
*   Implemented and validated Money Flow Index (MFI) calculation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (customizable period, volume-weighted RSI).
*   **Refactored `technical_analysis.py`:** (Completed)
    *   Modified TA calculation functions (BB, RSI, MACD, IMI, MFI, FVG) to accept a Pandas DataFrame and symbol as input.
    *   Ensured functions return DataFrames with new indicator columns.
    *   Removed AAPL-specific hardcoding and file I/O dependencies for dashboard integration.
    *   Created a helper function `calculate_all_technical_indicators` to apply all indicators to a given DataFrame.
    *   Implemented a generic `aggregate_candles` function for resampling timeframes.
*   **Integrated Technical Analysis into `dashboard_app.py`:** (Completed)
    *   In `update_tech_indicators_tab` callback, implemented fetching of minute data for the selected symbol.
    *   Implemented logic to aggregate minute data into 1-minute, 15-minute, hourly, and daily DataFrames using `aggregate_candles`.
    *   Called refactored TA functions from `technical_analysis.py` for each aggregated DataFrame.
    *   Handled cases with insufficient data (TA functions return NaNs, UI displays "N/A").
    *   Structured calculated TA values (latest values) for display in `dash_table.DataTable`.
    *   Updated `tech-indicators-table` to display real data, replacing dummy data, with columns: "Indicator", "1min", "15min", "Hourly", "Daily".
*   **Fixed `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_app.py` (f-string quotes & backslashes):** (Completed)
    *   Corrected nested quote usage in f-strings for 'Implied Volatility', 'Delta', 'Gamma', 'Theta', and 'Vega' fields in the `update_options_chain_stream_data` callback, resolving a user-reported syntax error.
    *   Removed erroneous backslashes from f-string expressions for 'Gamma', 'Theta', and 'Vega' that were causing `SyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash`, resolving a subsequent user-reported syntax error.
*   **Updated Documentation Files:** (Completed for this phase)
    *   `DECISIONS.md`: Documented architectural choices for TA integration and all syntax error fixes.
    *   `PROGRESS.md`: Updated to reflect current status.
    *   `TODO.md`: Updated task statuses.

*   Investigated user-reported Dash duplicate output error for `error-message-store.data`. Confirmed that all relevant callbacks in `dashboard_app.py` in the repository correctly use `allow_duplicate=True`. The issue might have been with a local, out-of-sync version of the file. (2025-05-16)

*   Addressed user-reported `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py` (2025-05-16).

## Current Work In Progress

*   Preparing for the next phase of development (e.g., user customization of TA parameters, FVG display enhancements, addressing known issues).

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Pandas FutureWarning:** The `technical_analysis.py` script currently shows `FutureWarning` messages from pandas related to dtype compatibility when setting boolean values for FVG. This does not currently block functionality but should be addressed in the future for cleaner execution and to prevent potential issues with future pandas versions.
*   **RSI Customization:** The existing RSI function in `technical_analysis.py` does not currently support customizable overbought/oversold levels directly as parameters. This can be considered for future enhancement.
*   **FVG Display:** Fair Value Gaps (FVG) currently produce multiple columns (`fvg_bullish_top`, `fvg_bullish_bottom`, etc.) in the backend. The UI table shows "N/A" for FVG as a simple representation of the latest FVG status (e.g., if the last candle confirmed one) is not yet implemented in the table formatting logic. This requires further design for effective UI display.
*   **Error Display in UI:** While errors are logged and some are passed to the `error-message-store`, the display and granularity of errors related to TA calculation in the UI could be improved.

## Next Steps

1.  **Push all updated code and documentation files (`PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `technical_analysis.py`, `dashboard_app.py`) to the GitHub repository.**
2.  **Notify user of the progress, including the successful integration of technical analysis into the dashboard, the fixes for all reported syntax errors, and the push of these updates.**
3.  **Address known issues, particularly FVG display and enhanced error handling in the UI.**
4.  **Begin work on user customization for TA parameters.**
5.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features** as outlined in `TODO.md` (if applicable after addressing immediate enhancements).



*   **Investigated Dash Callback Error (2025-05-16):** Investigated user-reported Dash duplicate output error: `In the callback for output(s): tech-indicators-table.columns tech-indicators-table.data error-message-store.data@... Output 2 (error-message-store.data@...) is already in use.` Confirmed that all relevant callbacks in `dashboard_app.py` (specifically `update_minute_data_tab`, `update_tech_indicators_tab`, `manage_options_stream`, and `update_options_chain_stream_data`) that output to `error-message-store.data` correctly use the `allow_duplicate=True` parameter. No code changes were required in the repository as the existing implementation is correct. The reported error likely stemmed from a local, out-of-sync version of the `dashboard_app.py` file on the user's side or an older version prior to these flags being implemented consistently.

*   **Merged Callbacks for Minute Data and Technical Indicators (2025-05-16):**
    *   Successfully merged the `update_minute_data_tab` and `update_tech_indicators_tab` callbacks into a single callback `update_data_for_active_tab` in `dashboard_app.py`.
    *   The new callback outputs to `minute-data-table.columns`, `minute-data-table.data`, `tech-indicators-table.columns`, `tech-indicators-table.data`, and `new-error-event-store.data`.
    *   This resolves the user's concern about `allow_duplicate=True` for `new-error-event-store.data` by ensuring a single callback owns this output.
    *   The merged callback uses the `tabs-main.value` (active tab ID) to determine which data to fetch and process, optimizing performance by not updating hidden tabs.
    *   Thoroughly tested the merged callback to ensure correct data display for both tables and robust error reporting to `new-error-event-store`.
*   **Updated Dash App Execution for Dash 3.x (2025-05-16):**
    *   Modified `dashboard_app.py` to use `app.run()` instead of the deprecated `app.run_server()` for Dash 3.x compatibility.
    *   Successfully tested app launch and basic functionality with this change.

## Current Work In Progress

*   Finalizing documentation updates for the recent callback merge and Dash 3.x compatibility.
*   Preparing to push all updated code and documentation to the GitHub repository.

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Schwab API Credentials:** The application currently logs an error `Initial REST Client Error: Error: APP_KEY, APP_SECRET, or CALLBACK_URL not found in environment variables.` This is expected in the sandbox as these are not set up, but the application should function for non-authenticated data fetching where possible. For full functionality, the user will need to ensure these are correctly set in their environment.
*   **Pandas FutureWarning:** The `technical_analysis.py` script currently shows `FutureWarning` messages from pandas related to dtype compatibility when setting boolean values for FVG. This does not currently block functionality but should be addressed in the future for cleaner execution and to prevent potential issues with future pandas versions.
*   **RSI Customization:** The existing RSI function in `technical_analysis.py` does not currently support customizable overbought/oversold levels directly as parameters. This can be considered for future enhancement.
*   **FVG Display:** Fair Value Gaps (FVG) currently produce multiple columns (`fvg_bullish_top`, `fvg_bullish_bottom`, etc.) in the backend. The UI table shows "N/A" for FVG as a simple representation of the latest FVG status (e.g., if the last candle confirmed one) is not yet implemented in the table formatting logic. This requires further design for effective UI display.
*   **Error Display in UI:** While errors are logged and some are passed to the `error-message-store`, the display and granularity of errors related to TA calculation in the UI could be improved.
