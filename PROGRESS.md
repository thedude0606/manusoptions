## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-15)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name 'StreamService' from 'schwabdev.stream'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic and UI visualization for Bollinger Bands (BB) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` and `dashboard_app.py`.** (UI part was before user clarification)
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic and UI visualization for Relative Strength Index (RSI) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` and `dashboard_app.py`.** (UI part was before user clarification)
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic for Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` for table data and pattern detection.**

## Current Work In Progress

*   **Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform - Core Technical Analysis Engine**
    *   Status: In Progress
    *   Details: Completed Bollinger Bands (Backend & UI - UI as per old plan), RSI (Backend & UI - UI as per old plan), and MACD (Backend only). Preparing for the next indicator (e.g., IMI - backend only).

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Historical Data Truncation (Previously Encountered):** While resolved with workarounds for specific files, vigilance is needed if similar issues arise with large log files or source code files during debugging.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Intraday Momentum Index (IMI) calculation logic (backend only for table data and pattern detection).** (High Priority - Phase 2)
2.  **Ensure `requirements.txt` file is fully up-to-date:** Document all Python dependencies for the project.
3.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features:**
    *   Implement other technical indicators (MFI etc. - backend only) as per `TODO.md`.
    *   (Refer to `TODO.md` for the detailed breakdown of all Phase 2 tasks).
