# PROGRESS

This document outlines the progress made on the Manus Options project, detailing completed tasks, ongoing work, identified challenges, and the next steps in development.

## Current Status and Achievements

Work commenced by cloning the specified GitHub repository, `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions`, to establish a local development environment. The primary initial task was to address a critical `ModuleNotFoundError` related to `schwabdev.streamer_client`, which prevented the `dashboard_app.py` application from running. The investigation revealed that the project lacked a standard Python dependency management file, such as `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.

Following this, research was conducted using the provided example repository (`https://github.com/tylerebowers/Schwabdev`) and its associated documentation (`https://tylerebowers.github.io/Schwabdev/`). This research confirmed that the `schwabdev` library was the correct dependency for interacting with the Schwab API. The `schwabdev` package was subsequently installed using `pip3`. During the validation phase, further `ModuleNotFoundError`s emerged for other packages, specifically `dash` and `python-dotenv`. These dependencies were also installed iteratively to allow the application to proceed with its import sequence.

A significant finding during this process was that the original import `from schwabdev.streamer_client import StreamerClient` was no longer valid. The `schwabdev` library had undergone changes, and the `StreamerClient` class or `streamer_client` module was either deprecated or restructured. The current method for accessing streaming functionality, as indicated by the library's documentation, is through the `client.stream` attribute of an authenticated `schwabdev.Client` instance.

Consequently, a key architectural update was performed. The `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` file was refactored to align with this new API. This involved removing the direct import of `StreamerClient` and modifying the `StreamingManager` class to initialize and utilize the streamer via `schwab_api_client.stream`. The import for `StreamService` was also updated to `from schwabdev.stream import StreamService`, and the `account_id` was passed to the `stream_client.start()` method as it was previously part of the `StreamerClient` initialization. After these modifications, `dashboard_app.py` was executed again, and it successfully started the Dash server without any import errors, indicating that the core dependency and API usage issues have been resolved.

## Completed Features or Tasks

- Successfully cloned the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions`.
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'`.
- Identified the absence of a formal dependency management file and determined the necessary dependencies through iterative testing and documentation review.
- Installed required Python packages: `schwabdev`, `dash`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Researched and understood the updated streaming API for the `schwabdev` library.
- Refactored the `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` to use the current `schwabdev` streaming API (`client.stream` instead of `StreamerClient`).
- Validated that `dashboard_app.py` now runs without import errors, and the Dash server starts successfully.
- Created initial versions of `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` and have begun updating them iteratively.

## Known Issues or Challenges (Resolved)

- The primary `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'` has been resolved by refactoring the code to use the new `schwabdev` streaming API.
- The absence of a `requirements.txt` file was addressed by manually identifying and installing dependencies. A `requirements.txt` file should be generated as a next step to formalize dependency management.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve comprehensively updating the `DECISIONS.md` file to document the architectural changes made, particularly the rationale for refactoring the `StreamingManager`. Following this, all updated code and documentation files (`streaming_manager.py`, `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`) will be committed to the local Git repository. These changes will then be pushed to the user's GitHub repository. Finally, a status report will be provided to the user, summarizing the actions taken and the current state of the project. Future work will include generating a `requirements.txt` file and addressing any further enhancements or issues as requested by the user.
