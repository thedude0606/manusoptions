## Completed Features/Tasks (as of 2025-05-15)

*   Initial repository setup and cloning.
*   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'`.
*   Addressed `ImportError: cannot import name 'StreamService' from 'schwabdev.stream'`.
*   Implemented use of `.env` for `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` and made it optional for market data streams.
*   Fixed premature `_stream_worker` thread termination in `StreamingManager`.
*   Corrected handling of Schwab API confirmation/administrative messages.
*   Implemented multiple rounds of diagnostic logging to trace data flow for empty options tables.
*   Resolved UI data propagation issue by parsing option type (Call/Put) from the contract key in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Fixed `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   Corrected Schwab stream field mapping in `StreamingManager` based on user-provided mapping.
*   Resolved `SyntaxError` in `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` (placeholder line).
*   Implemented `get_status()`, `get_latest_data()`, and `stop_stream()` methods in `StreamingManager`.
*   Implemented data merging logic in `StreamingManager` (partial).
*   Fixed f-string `SyntaxError` in `StreamingManager`.
*   Addressed dashboard data formatting issues (partial).
*   Fixed `ObsoleteAttributeException` by updating `app.run_server` to `app.run` in `dashboard_app.py`.
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic and UI visualization for Bollinger Bands (BB) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` and `dashboard_app.py`.** (UI part was before user clarification)
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic and UI visualization for Relative Strength Index (RSI) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` and `dashboard_app.py`.** (UI part was before user clarification)
*   **Phase 2: Implemented backend logic for Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in `analysis_utils/technical_indicators.py` for table data and pattern detection.**

## Current Work In Progress

*   **Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform - Core Technical Analysis Engine (Revised for Multi-Timeframe Table UI - May 15, 2025)**
    *   Status: Starting implementation of multi-timeframe data aggregation and UI table display.
    *   Details: Will begin by adapting MACD (backend logic already complete) for multi-timeframe aggregation and display in a new UI table. Subsequently, BB and RSI will be refactored to fit this new table UI, and then new indicators (IMI, MFI) will follow the same pattern.

## Known Issues or Challenges

*   **Historical Data Truncation (Previously Encountered):** Vigilance is needed if similar issues arise with large log files or source code files during debugging.
*   **Multi-Timeframe Data Acquisition:** Ensuring reliable fetching and aggregation of price data for 1min, 15min, 1h, and Daily intervals will be a key challenge.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Backend Data Aggregation for MACD:** Fetch/aggregate price data for 1min, 15min, 1h, Daily timeframes and calculate MACD for each.
2.  **Implement UI Table for MACD:** Display the multi-timeframe MACD values in a Dash DataTable in `dashboard_app.py`.
3.  **Refactor BB and RSI for Table UI:** Adapt existing Bollinger Bands and RSI to use multi-timeframe data and display in the new table.
4.  **Implement IMI (Backend & Table UI):** Develop backend logic for IMI, aggregate for multiple timeframes, and integrate into the UI table.
5.  **Ensure `requirements.txt` file is fully up-to-date:** Document all Python dependencies for the project.
6.  **Continue with Phase 2: Options Recommendation Platform Features:**
    *   Implement other technical indicators (MFI etc. - backend & table UI) as per `TODO.md`.
    *   (Refer to `TODO.md` for the detailed breakdown of all Phase 2 tasks).
