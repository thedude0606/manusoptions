# PROGRESS.md

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Cloned the GitHub repository `thedude0606/manusoptions`.
- Investigated the error: `calculate_all_technical_indicators() got an unexpected keyword argument 'period_name'`.
- Identified the cause of the `period_name` argument error in `dashboard_app.py`.
- Fixed the `calculate_all_technical_indicators()` error by correcting the arguments in `dashboard_app.py` (removed `period_name` and updated `symbol` argument to include period information).
- Pushed initial fix and tracking files to GitHub.
- Investigated new error: `MinData-Format-SPY: Index is not DatetimeIndex after fetch.`
- Identified the cause of the `DatetimeIndex` error in `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py` (timestamp column was converted to string and named 'Timestamp' instead of 'timestamp').
- Fixed the `DatetimeIndex` error by ensuring the 'timestamp' column in `data_fetchers.py` remains a datetime object and is named 'timestamp' for consistency with `dashboard_app.py`.
- Investigated new error: `The truth value of a Series is ambiguous` in RSI calculation.
- Identified the cause of the Series truth value error in `technical_analysis.py` (improper handling of pandas Series in a conditional expression).
- Fixed the Series truth value error by using nested `np.where` calls to properly handle Series objects in the RSI calculation.
- Fixed the technical indicator tab issues with N/A and strange values by ensuring proper handling of Series objects in conditional expressions and maintaining consistent column naming.
- Investigated new error: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'price_history'` in client handling.
- Identified the cause of the tuple error in `dashboard_app.py` (the tuple returned by `get_schwab_client()` was being passed to functions instead of just the client object).
- Fixed the Schwab client handling by ensuring only the client instance (not the tuple) is passed to downstream functions.
- Investigated new error: `'dict' object has no attribute 'columns'` in technical indicator processing.
- Identified the cause of the dict vs DataFrame error in `dashboard_app.py` (inconsistent handling of technical analysis results).
- Fixed the technical indicator processing by ensuring all results are consistently stored as DataFrames.
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the technical indicator processing flow for better debugging.
- Updated all documentation files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md) to reflect the changes and rationale.
- Pushed all changes to GitHub.
- Identified new issue with technical indicators tab: "No valid OHLCV columns found for aggregation" error in logs.
- Analyzed the column name mismatch between data fetchers (uppercase 'Open', 'High', etc.) and technical analysis module (lowercase 'open', 'high', etc.).
- Created validation framework to verify terminal output against technical indicators tab data.
- Implemented validation script (`validate_technical_indicators.py`) to detect and fix column name mismatches.
- Created sample data generator (`sample_data_generator.py`) for testing the validation process.
- Fixed the column name mismatch in `data_fetchers.py` by changing column names to lowercase.
- Added column normalization logic to `dashboard_app.py` to ensure compatibility with technical analysis functions.
- Tested the fixes with sample data and confirmed that aggregation and technical analysis now work correctly.
- Pushed all updated files to GitHub.
- Implemented CSV export functionality for the minute data tab to allow data verification and analysis.
- Added an "Export to CSV" button to the minute data tab UI.
- Created a callback to generate and serve CSV files when the export button is clicked.
- Added data storage mechanism to ensure all minute data is available for export.
- Ensured exported CSV files include symbol name and timestamp in the filename for easy identification.
- Implemented CSV export functionality for the technical indicators tab to allow data verification and analysis.
- Added an "Export to CSV" button to the technical indicators tab UI.
- Created callback to generate and serve CSV files when the export button is clicked.
- Added data storage mechanism (tech-indicators-store) to ensure all technical indicators data is available for export.
- Ensured exported CSV files include symbol name and timestamp in the filename for easy identification.
- Modified the technical indicators tab to display and export full historical series instead of just the most recent value.
- Added a timeframe dropdown selector to allow viewing different timeframes (1min, 15min, Hourly, Daily).
- Updated the data storage mechanism to store complete historical data for all timeframes.
- Enhanced the CSV export functionality to export the full historical series for the selected timeframe.
- Created a comprehensive candlestick pattern detection module (candlestick_patterns.py) with both traditional and advanced patterns.
- Implemented detection for traditional single-candle patterns (Doji, Hammer/Hanging Man, Inverted Hammer/Shooting Star, Marubozu).
- Implemented detection for traditional multi-candle patterns (Engulfing, Morning/Evening Star, Harami).
- Implemented detection for advanced price action concepts (Order Blocks, Liquidity Grabs, Market Structure Shifts, Mitigation Blocks).
- Designed the module to follow the same structure and error handling approach as the existing technical indicators.
- Conducted comprehensive validation of all technical indicators across different timeframes (1-minute, 15-minute, Hourly, Daily).
- Analyzed the implementation code in technical_analysis.py and candlestick_patterns.py to understand calculation logic.
- Cross-referenced code logic with observed data patterns to validate indicator calculations.
- Identified critical issue with MACD calculation when data is in reverse chronological order.
- Discovered that the MACD calculation code incorrectly marks recent values as NaN when data is in reverse order.
- Developed detailed documentation explaining the MACD calculation issue and recommended solutions.
- Created a fix proposal to sort the DataFrame by timestamp in ascending order before calculating indicators.

## Current Work in Progress

- Implementing fix for MACD calculation issue with reverse chronological data.
- Updating documentation to reflect the MACD calculation issue and solution.
- Preparing to push code changes and documentation updates to GitHub.

## Known Issues/Challenges

- MACD calculation issue: When data is in reverse chronological order (newest first), the code incorrectly marks the most recent values as NaN instead of the oldest values.
- This issue affects all time-dependent indicators that mark early values as unreliable, not just MACD.
- The current implementation assumes data is in ascending chronological order, which doesn't match the actual data ordering in the CSV exports.

## Next Steps

- Implement the recommended fix to sort the DataFrame by timestamp in ascending order before calculating indicators.
- Add a warning log when data is detected to be in reverse chronological order to help with debugging.
- Create unit tests that specifically test both ascending and descending data order scenarios.
- Review other technical indicators for similar assumptions about data ordering.
- Consider adding a configuration option to preserve the original data order in the output if needed.
- Complete the integration of candlestick patterns with the technical indicators chart.
- Validate the candlestick pattern detection functionality with real market data.
- Consider implementing visualization components for candlestick patterns.
- Explore opportunities for performance optimization in the technical indicator calculations.
