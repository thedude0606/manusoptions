## Progress Log

### Completed Features/Tasks

*   **Initial Setup & Debugging (fetch_options_chain.py):**
    *   Cloned GitHub repository.
    *   Analyzed `fetch_options_chain.py` and `auth_script.py`.
    *   Resolved initial `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'token_manager'`.
    *   Resolved subsequent `AttributeError: 'Tokens' object has no attribute 'is_access_token_expired'`.
    *   Ensured script correctly handles token loading and refresh via `client.tokens.update_tokens()`.
*   **Tracking Files Setup:**
    *   Created `PROGRESS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`.
    *   Pushed initial tracking files to GitHub.
*   **Streaming Functionality (Initial Implementation):**
    *   Reviewed Schwab API streaming documentation and examples.
    *   Designed and implemented basic streaming logic for options chain data in `fetch_options_chain.py`.
    *   Added an `APP_MODE` to switch between "FETCH" and "STREAM" modes.
    *   Implemented a message handler for `LEVELONE_OPTIONS` service.
    *   Implemented logic to detect changes in streamed contract metrics.
    *   Added a 5-second interval display for detected changes, overwriting previous output.
    *   Added support for streaming multiple underlying symbols.
    *   Added logic to fetch all option contract keys for specified symbols.
    *   Implemented subscription to option contracts in manageable chunks.
*   **Efficient Contract Filtering for Streaming:**
    *   Clarified filtering requirements with the user.
    *   Modified script to filter contracts based on:
        *   Minimum Open Interest (excluding contracts with zero OI by default).
        *   Specific Days To Expiration (DTE), including 0DTE.
    *   Updated `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` function to apply these filters before subscribing to the stream.
*   **Syntax Error Resolution:**
    *   Systematically scanned and corrected all f-string syntax errors related to quote usage and dictionary key access throughout `fetch_options_chain.py`.
    *   Ensured all print formatting uses appropriate methods (f-strings with correct quoting or `.format()`).
*   **Debugging Contract Filtering:**
    *   ~~Added diagnostic printing in `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` to display raw contract data (symbol, OI, DTE) before filters are applied.~~ (Superseded)
    *   Modified `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` to write raw contract data (symbol, OI, DTE) to a log file (`raw_contracts_diag.log`) for comprehensive analysis.

### Current Work In Progress

*   Awaiting user to run the script with diagnostic logging and provide the `raw_contracts_diag.log` file for analysis.
*   Refining contract filtering logic based on diagnostic log output.

### Known Issues or Challenges

*   Full end-to-end streaming and data validation requires valid Schwab API credentials and user authentication via `auth_script.py`. Current sandbox testing uses dummy credentials, so API calls for data will fail after client initialization if not using live credentials.
*   The Schwab API might have limits on the number of concurrent stream subscriptions. The script uses a `MAX_CONTRACTS_PER_STREAM_SUBSCRIPTION` setting, but this might need adjustment based on real-world usage.
*   The `Schwab_Trader_API_Streamer_Guide.pdf` was not accessible (404 error), so implementation relies on other provided examples and general API knowledge.

### Next Steps

*   User to run the modified `fetch_options_chain.py` and share the `raw_contracts_diag.log` file.
*   Analyze the diagnostic log to understand API data for OI and DTE.
*   Adjust filtering logic in `get_filtered_option_contract_keys` if necessary.
*   Test the refined filtering.
*   Address any further issues identified during user testing.
*   Discuss further enhancements or new features for the options trading platform.
