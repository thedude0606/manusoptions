# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Analyzed repository structure and code
- Identified issues with minute data handling and technical indicator calculations
- Designed solutions for standardizing 60-day minute data pulls and implementing multi-timeframe indicators
- Documented design decisions in DECISIONS.md

## Completed Tasks
- Repository analysis and code review
- Identified that `fetch_minute_data.py` uses 90 days instead of the required 60 days
- Confirmed `fetch_minute_data_batched.py` already implements 60-day pulls
- Identified that technical indicators need to be calculated for multiple timeframes
- Created design documentation for required changes

## In Progress
- Implementing standardized 60-day minute data pull in all data fetching scripts
- Developing multi-timeframe technical indicator calculation functionality
- Updating configuration to support the new requirements

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to ensure consistent 60-day data pull across all scripts
- Technical indicators need to be calculated for 5 different timeframes (1min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, daily)
- Integration with existing dashboard may require UI updates for timeframe selection

## Next Steps
1. Update `fetch_minute_data.py` to use 60 days consistently
2. Implement multi-timeframe technical indicator calculations in `technical_analysis.py`
3. Update any dependent code to handle the new multi-timeframe data structure
4. Create tests to validate the changes
5. Update documentation to reflect the new functionality
