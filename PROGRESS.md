## Progress Log

### Completed Features or Tasks

*   Cloned GitHub repository: `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions` on 2025-05-14.
*   Analyzed `fetch_options_chain.py` and `auth_script.py` to understand current implementation on 2025-05-14.
*   Reviewed `schwabdev` library usage based on provided example and code structure on 2025-05-14.

### Current Work in Progress

*   Diagnosing and preparing to fix the `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'token_manager'` in `fetch_options_chain.py`.
*   Creating and updating tracking files: PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, and DECISIONS.md.

### Known Issues or Challenges

*   The `fetch_options_chain.py` script incorrectly attempts to access `client.token_manager.tokens_valid()` and `client.token_manager.refresh_tokens()`. The `schwabdev.Client` object, as used in `auth_script.py` and indicated by common patterns in such libraries, does not appear to expose a `token_manager` attribute directly. Token management seems to be handled via the `client.tokens` object and its methods, or methods directly on the `client` object for checking token validity and refreshing.

### Next Steps

*   Modify `fetch_options_chain.py` to correctly handle token validation and refresh using the `client.tokens` object or appropriate methods of the `schwabdev.Client`, aligning with the approach in `auth_script.py` and `schwabdev` library's intended use.
*   Create the initial versions of TODO.md and DECISIONS.md.
*   Test the corrected `fetch_options_chain.py` script. This may initially involve checking if the `AttributeError` is resolved. Full data fetching will require a valid token, which the user will provide after authentication.
*   Push the corrected code and the newly created tracking files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md) to the user's GitHub repository.
