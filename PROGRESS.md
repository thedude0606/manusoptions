# Progress Report

## May 29, 2025

### Completed Features/Tasks
- Fixed minute tab and technical indicators tab data tables display issues
- Added comprehensive debugging for recommendation engine
- Added debug information panel to recommendation tab UI
- Improved error handling in recommendation generation process
- Enhanced recommendation engine with improved confidence scoring
- Refined filtering logic to be less aggressive
- Fixed profit calculation to produce more realistic values
- Improved market direction analysis with better signal detection
- Implemented timeframe bias indicator showing dominant trend direction for each timeframe
- Integrated timeframe bias with recommendation engine for enhanced signal detection
- Added bias confidence scoring to improve recommendation quality
- Fixed TypeError in recommendation engine when handling numpy arrays in tech_indicators_dict
- Fixed TypeError when tech_indicators_dict is not a dictionary by adding robust type checking
- Fixed options chain data table not updating with streaming data by improving contract key normalization
- Added enhanced debugging to streaming data updates to identify contract key matching issues
- Fixed AttributeError in recommendation generation when selected_symbol is a string instead of a dictionary
- Added comprehensive streaming debug monitor to track and diagnose streaming data issues
- Enhanced logging for streaming data updates with detailed tracking of data flow
- Added dedicated streaming debug panel with real-time statistics and diagnostics
- Improved streaming data update callback to ensure recommendations are refreshed with latest data

### Current Work in Progress
- Testing enhanced recommendation engine with timeframe bias integration
- Validating recommendation quality and confidence scores with the new indicator
- Monitoring streaming data updates to ensure consistent data flow
- Validating streaming debug monitor effectiveness in diagnosing update issues

### Known Issues/Challenges
- Previous recommendation tables showed very low confidence scores (10.0)
- Unrealistic profit expectations in previous implementation (up to 195%)
- Limited number of recommendations due to overly strict filtering
- Streaming data updates may not be consistently applied to options chain tables
- Contract key format differences between REST API and streaming data causing matching issues
- Streaming data may not be triggering recommendation updates as expected

### Next Steps
- Validate the improved recommendation engine with real-world data
- Test timeframe bias indicator across different market conditions
- Consider additional UI improvements to display timeframe bias information
- Add Safari export button fix
- Implement additional technical indicators if needed
- Enhance streaming data integration with recommendation engine
- Improve contract key normalization to increase match rate between streaming data and options chain
- Add automated testing for streaming data updates
