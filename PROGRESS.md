# PROGRESS.md

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Cloned the GitHub repository `thedude0606/manusoptions`.
- Investigated the error: `calculate_all_technical_indicators() got an unexpected keyword argument 'period_name'`.
- Identified the cause of the `period_name` argument error in `dashboard_app.py`.
- Fixed the `calculate_all_technical_indicators()` error by correcting the arguments in `dashboard_app.py` (removed `period_name` and updated `symbol` argument to include period information).
- Pushed initial fix and tracking files to GitHub.
- Investigated new error: `MinData-Format-SPY: Index is not DatetimeIndex after fetch.`
- Identified the cause of the `DatetimeIndex` error in `dashboard_utils/data_fetchers.py` (timestamp column was converted to string and named 'Timestamp' instead of 'timestamp').
- Fixed the `DatetimeIndex` error by ensuring the 'timestamp' column in `data_fetchers.py` remains a datetime object and is named 'timestamp' for consistency with `dashboard_app.py`.
- Investigated new error: `The truth value of a Series is ambiguous` in RSI calculation.
- Identified the cause of the Series truth value error in `technical_analysis.py` (improper handling of pandas Series in a conditional expression).
- Fixed the Series truth value error by using nested `np.where` calls to properly handle Series objects in the RSI calculation.
- Fixed the technical indicator tab issues with N/A and strange values by ensuring proper handling of Series objects in conditional expressions and maintaining consistent column naming.
- Investigated new error: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'price_history'` in client handling.
- Identified the cause of the tuple error in `dashboard_app.py` (the tuple returned by `get_schwab_client()` was being passed to functions instead of just the client object).
- Fixed the Schwab client handling by ensuring only the client instance (not the tuple) is passed to downstream functions.
- Investigated new error: `'dict' object has no attribute 'columns'` in technical indicator processing.
- Identified the cause of the dict vs DataFrame error in `dashboard_app.py` (inconsistent handling of technical analysis results).
- Fixed the technical indicator processing by ensuring all results are consistently stored as DataFrames.
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the technical indicator processing flow for better debugging.
- Updated all documentation files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md) to reflect the changes and rationale.
- Pushed all changes to GitHub.
- Identified new issue with technical indicators tab: "No valid OHLCV columns found for aggregation" error in logs.
- Analyzed the column name mismatch between data fetchers (uppercase 'Open', 'High', etc.) and technical analysis module (lowercase 'open', 'high', etc.).
- Created validation framework to verify terminal output against technical indicators tab data.
- Implemented validation script (`validate_technical_indicators.py`) to detect and fix column name mismatches.
- Created sample data generator (`sample_data_generator.py`) for testing the validation process.
- Fixed the column name mismatch in `data_fetchers.py` by changing column names to lowercase.
- Added column normalization logic to `dashboard_app.py` to ensure compatibility with technical analysis functions.
- Tested the fixes with sample data and confirmed that aggregation and technical analysis now work correctly.
- Pushed all updated files to GitHub.
- Implemented CSV export functionality for the minute data tab to allow data verification and analysis.
- Added an "Export to CSV" button to the minute data tab UI.
- Created a callback to generate and serve CSV files when the export button is clicked.
- Added data storage mechanism to ensure all minute data is available for export.
- Ensured exported CSV files include symbol name and timestamp in the filename for easy identification.
- Implemented CSV export functionality for the technical indicators tab to allow data verification and analysis.
- Added an "Export to CSV" button to the technical indicators tab UI.
- Created callback to generate and serve CSV files when the export button is clicked.
- Added data storage mechanism (tech-indicators-store) to ensure all technical indicators data is available for export.
- Ensured exported CSV files include symbol name and timestamp in the filename for easy identification.
- Modified the technical indicators tab to display and export full historical series instead of just the most recent value.
- Added a timeframe dropdown selector to allow viewing different timeframes (1min, 15min, Hourly, Daily).
- Updated the data storage mechanism to store complete historical data for all timeframes.
- Enhanced the CSV export functionality to export the full historical series for the selected timeframe.
- Created a comprehensive candlestick pattern detection module (candlestick_patterns.py) with both traditional and advanced patterns.
- Implemented detection for traditional single-candle patterns (Doji, Hammer/Hanging Man, Inverted Hammer/Shooting Star, Marubozu).
- Implemented detection for traditional multi-candle patterns (Engulfing, Morning/Evening Star, Harami).
- Implemented detection for advanced price action concepts (Order Blocks, Liquidity Grabs, Market Structure Shifts, Mitigation Blocks).
- Designed the module to follow the same structure and error handling approach as the existing technical indicators.
- Conducted comprehensive validation of all technical indicators across different timeframes (1-minute, 15-minute, Hourly, Daily).
- Analyzed the implementation code in technical_analysis.py and candlestick_patterns.py to understand calculation logic.
- Cross-referenced code logic with observed data patterns to validate indicator calculations.
- Identified critical issue with MACD calculation when data is in reverse chronological order.
- Discovered that the MACD calculation code incorrectly marks recent values as NaN when data is in reverse order.
- Developed detailed documentation explaining the MACD calculation issue and recommended solutions.
- Created a fix proposal to sort the DataFrame by timestamp in ascending order before calculating indicators.
- Identified issue with options chain streaming where Last, Bid, and Ask fields were blank in the UI.
- Investigated the streaming field subscription in fetch_options_chain.py and found that these fields were not being requested.
- Fixed the options chain streaming by updating STREAMING_OPTION_FIELDS_REQUEST to include field codes for Last (4), Bid (2), and Ask (3).
- Updated STREAMING_FIELD_MAPPING to include the new fields with appropriate names (LastPrice, BidPrice, AskPrice).
- Implemented file-based logging to address the issue of missing log files when running the application.
- Added file handlers to all loggers in dashboard_app.py, data_fetchers.py, and streaming_manager.py.
- Enhanced logging for options chain data to better diagnose issues with Last, Bid, and Ask fields.
- Added detailed logging of streaming data updates to track field values in real-time.
- Created a logs directory to store all log files with timestamps in filenames.
- Identified root cause of Last, Bid, Ask fields showing as None in options streaming: incorrect contract key formatting.
- Implemented proper contract key formatting for streaming compatibility in both data_fetchers.py and streaming_manager.py.
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track raw API responses and verify contract key formatting.
- Created a dedicated format_contract_key_for_streaming function to ensure consistent key formatting across modules.
- Enhanced streaming_manager.py to log full raw messages from the Schwab API for better troubleshooting.

## Current Work in Progress

- Pushing updated code with contract key formatting fix and enhanced logging to GitHub.
- Testing the enhanced logging functionality to ensure it captures all necessary diagnostic information.
- Verifying that Last, Bid, and Ask fields are properly displayed in the options streaming tab.

## Known Issues/Challenges

- ✅ FIXED: MACD calculation issue with reverse chronological data. Implemented a fix to ensure data is sorted in ascending chronological order before technical indicator calculations.
- ✅ FIXED: Issue affecting all time-dependent indicators that mark early values as unreliable when data is in reverse chronological order.
- ✅ FIXED: Missing log files when running the application. Implemented file-based logging with timestamped log files.
- ✅ FIXED: Last, Bid, and Ask fields not showing up in options streaming tab. Identified root cause as incorrect contract key formatting and implemented proper formatting for streaming compatibility.

## Next Steps
