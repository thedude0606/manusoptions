## Medium Priority
- [x] Update any dependent code to handle multi-timeframe data
- [ ] Create tests for the new functionality
- [x] Update documentation to reflect changes
- [x] Optimize streaming performance and error handling
- [ ] Add visual indicators for fields updated via streaming data
- [ ] Implement caching for normalized contract keys to improve performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for the Recommendations tab functionality
- [ ] Implement additional debugging tools for easier troubleshooting
- [ ] Add more detailed logging for streaming data processing

## Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize performance for multi-timeframe calculations
- [ ] Consider UI improvements for timeframe selection
- [ ] Add user controls for streaming settings (e.g., update frequency)
- [ ] Create a debug mode toggle for enhanced logging in production

## Dependencies
- Multi-timeframe indicator implementation depends on standardized 60-day data pull
- Dashboard updates depend on multi-timeframe indicator implementation
- Options chain functionality depends on correct Schwab API method usage
- Recommendations tab functionality depends on selected-symbol-store being properly populated
- Real-time options updates depend on StreamingManager integration with dashboard_app.py
- Complete UI updates depend on proper mapping between streaming data fields and DataFrame columns
- Proper matching of streaming data to DataFrame rows depends on consistent contract key normalization
- Stable options chain display depends on proper state preservation between streaming updates
- Options chain data display depends on proper putCall field mapping from contractType
- Recommendations generation depends on button click being properly connected to callback
- Enhanced debug modules depend on core functionality being correctly implemented
- Improved error handling depends on comprehensive understanding of data flow and failure points
- Direct integration of enhanced modules depends on maintaining API compatibility

## Status Legend
- [x] Completed
- [ ] Not Started/In Progress
