# TODO List

## High Priority
- [x] Fix blank last, bid, and ask fields in the options chain tab
- [x] Implement contract key normalization for consistent matching between REST and streaming data
- [x] Enhance field mapping to handle both string and numeric field IDs from the stream
- [ ] Validate the fix in the web application
- [ ] Implement additional error handling for API responses

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve UI responsiveness for large option chains
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities to options tables
- [ ] Enhance data visualization for technical indicators

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add unit tests for contract key normalization and formatting
- [ ] Add unit tests for options chain data processing
- [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Dependencies
- Options chain display depends on proper data fetching from Schwab API
- Contract key normalization is required for proper matching between REST and streaming data
- Field mapping must handle both string and numeric field IDs for robust data processing
- Technical indicator calculations depend on minute data availability
