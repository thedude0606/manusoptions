## TODO List

### Setup and Initial Debugging

- [x] Clone GitHub repository (`https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions`)
- [x] Analyze `fetch_options_chain.py` for `AttributeError`
- [x] Review `auth_script.py` and `schwabdev` library usage for token management
- [x] Create `PROGRESS.md` and populate initial content
- [ ] Create `TODO.md` and populate initial tasks (this task)
- [ ] Create `DECISIONS.md` and populate initial decisions/observations
- [x] Modify `fetch_options_chain.py` to fix `AttributeError` by using `client.tokens` (or equivalent `schwabdev` methods) for token validation and refresh.
- [x] Test the corrected `fetch_options_chain.py` (AttributeError resolved; script now proceeds to credential/token validation).
- [ ] Push all code changes and tracking files (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md) to the GitHub repository. (This task)
- [ ] Request user to set up `.env` file and `tokens.json` for full testing with real data (or provide callback URL for me to test).

### Future Enhancements (Placeholder)

- [ ] Implement further enhancements based on user requests.
