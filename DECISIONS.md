# Architectural Decisions

## Callback Refactoring (May 20, 2025)

### Problem
The Dash application is experiencing errors due to duplicate callback outputs, particularly for:
- error-store.data
- options-chain-store.data
- expiration-date-dropdown.options
- expiration-date-dropdown.value
- options-chain-status.children

These errors occur because multiple callbacks are targeting the same outputs, which is not allowed in Dash unless explicitly permitted with `allow_duplicate=True`. While using `allow_duplicate=True` is a quick fix, it's not the recommended approach as it can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

### Solution
Refactor the callbacks by combining those that share outputs into single callback functions. This approach:
1. Eliminates the need for `allow_duplicate=True`
2. Reduces the risk of race conditions
3. Improves code maintainability
4. Follows Dash best practices

### Implementation Strategy
1. Identify all callbacks that share outputs
2. Combine these callbacks into unified functions
3. Use `dash.callback_context` to determine which input triggered the callback
4. Preserve all existing logic while consolidating the output generation
5. Ensure all edge cases are handled properly

### Benefits
- Resolves the duplicate callback outputs error
- Improves application stability
- Reduces potential for race conditions
- Makes the codebase more maintainable
- Follows Dash framework best practices
