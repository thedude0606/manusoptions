# DECISIONS

This document records key architectural choices, technology selections, design patterns used, and the rationale for important decisions made during the development of the Manus Options project.

## Initial Setup and Error Resolution

- **Decision (2025-05-14):** Address the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schwabdev.streamer_client'` as the first priority.
  - **Rationale:** This error prevents the application from running, blocking further development and testing.
- **Decision (2025-05-14):** Clone the GitHub repository `https://github.com/thedude0606/manusoptions` to the local sandbox environment for development.
  - **Rationale:** Direct access to the codebase is necessary for debugging and implementing changes.
- **Decision (2025-05-14):** Create and maintain `TODO.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` files as requested by the user.
  - **Rationale:** To provide clear tracking of tasks, progress, and key decisions, facilitating collaboration and project management.



## Schwabdev Streaming API Update (2025-05-14)

- **Decision:** Refactor `dashboard_utils/streaming_manager.py` to use the `client.stream` attribute for accessing Schwab's streaming services, replacing the previous implementation that relied on `from schwabdev.streamer_client import StreamerClient`.
  - **Rationale:** During the initial investigation of a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `schwabdev.streamer_client`, it was discovered through the official `schwabdev` library documentation (specifically, the information available at `https://tylerebowers.github.io/Schwabdev/` and its linked pages like `https://tylerebowers.github.io/Schwabdev/?source=pages%2Fstream.html`) that the `StreamerClient` class and the `schwabdev.streamer_client` module are no longer the standard way to interact with the streaming API. The library has been updated, and the current, recommended approach is to obtain a stream object via the `stream` attribute of an authenticated `schwabdev.Client` instance (i.e., `schwab_api_client.stream`).
  This change was critical because the old import path directly caused the application to fail at startup. The refactor involved modifying the `StreamingManager` class to:
    1. Remove the outdated import: `from schwabdev.streamer_client import StreamerClient`.
    2. Import the main `schwabdev` library: `import schwabdev`.
    3. Obtain the stream handling object using `self.stream_client = schwab_api_client.stream` within the `_stream_worker` method, where `schwab_api_client` is an instance of `schwabdev.Client`.
    4. Update the import for `StreamService` to `from schwabdev.stream import StreamService` as this enum is now directly available from the `schwabdev.stream` module.
    5. Ensure that the `account_id` (account hash) is passed to the `self.stream_client.start()` method, as this was previously a parameter for the `StreamerClient` constructor and is necessary for the stream to function correctly for a specific account.
  This architectural adjustment ensures compatibility with the latest version of the `schwabdev` library, resolves the critical import error, and allows the application to correctly initialize and manage streaming data from the Schwab API. Adherence to the library's current API is essential for long-term maintainability and access to future updates or bug fixes in the `schwabdev` package.
