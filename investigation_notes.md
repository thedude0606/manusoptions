# Investigation of Dash Duplicate Output Error

**Error Reported by User:**
"In the callback for output(s): tech-indicators-table.columns tech-indicators-table.data error-message-store.data@... Output 2 (error-message-store.data@...) is already in use. To resolve this, set `allow_duplicate=True` on duplicate outputs, or combine the outputs into one callback function, distinguishing the trigger by using `dash.callback_context` if necessary."

**Analysis:**

The error indicates that the `Output("error-message-store", "data")` is targeted by multiple callbacks, and at least one of these instances is missing the `allow_duplicate=True` flag.

Looking at the code for `dashboard_app.py`:

1.  **`update_minute_data_tab` callback:**
    ```python
    @app.callback(
        Output("minute-data-table", "columns"),
        Output("minute-data-table", "data"),
        Output("error-message-store", "data", allow_duplicate=True), # Has allow_duplicate=True
        Input("selected-symbol-store", "data"),
        State("error-message-store", "data"),
        prevent_initial_call=True
    )
    ```
    This callback correctly uses `allow_duplicate=True` for the `error-message-store.data` output.

2.  **`update_tech_indicators_tab` callback:**
    ```python
    @app.callback(
        Output("tech-indicators-table", "columns"),
        Output("tech-indicators-table", "data"),
        Output("error-message-store", "data", allow_duplicate=True), # Has allow_duplicate=True
        Input("selected-symbol-store", "data"),
        State("error-message-store", "data"),
        prevent_initial_call=True
    )
    ```
    This callback also correctly uses `allow_duplicate=True`. The error message specifically mentions this callback's outputs, but the code seems correct here.

3.  **`update_options_chain_stream_data` callback:**
    This callback also updates the error store. I need to verify its definition from the full file content.
    A previous truncated read showed this callback. Let's assume its structure is similar:
    ```python
    @app.callback(
        Output("options-calls-table", "columns"),
        Output("options-calls-table", "data"),
        Output("options-puts-table", "columns"),
        Output("options-puts-table", "data"),
        Output("options-chain-stream-status", "children"),
        Output("error-message-store", "data"), # Potential missing allow_duplicate=True
        Input("options-chain-interval", "n_intervals"),
        State("selected-symbol-store", "data"),
        State("error-message-store", "data"),
        State("current-option-keys-store", "data")
    )
    ```
    If the `Output("error-message-store", "data")` in *this* callback is missing `allow_duplicate=True`, it would cause the error. The error message might be slightly misleading by pointing to the `update_tech_indicators_tab` if this is the actual culprit, or if the version of the code I last saw for `update_tech_indicators_tab` was already fixed but the user ran an older version for that part.

**Hypothesis:**
The most likely cause is that the `update_options_chain_stream_data` callback (or another less obvious one) is also writing to `Output("error-message-store", "data")` and is missing the `allow_duplicate=True` flag.

The error message mentioning "Output 2" could be a bit confusing. It might refer to the `error-message-store.data` as the second *problematic* output Dash encountered during initialization, or it's an internal reference.

**Next Step:**
Read the full `dashboard_app.py` again to locate all callbacks that have `Output("error-message-store", "data")` and verify if `allow_duplicate=True` is present in all of them. The one referenced in the error message (`update_tech_indicators_tab`) seems to have it, so the issue might be with another callback targeting the same output, or the user's local file is out of sync with my last view for that specific callback.

Given the error message points to the context of `tech-indicators-table` outputs, it's still possible the issue lies there, perhaps due to a subtle syntax issue or an older version of that specific callback being run by the user. However, the most common cause is a missing `allow_duplicate=True` on one of the writers.

I will proceed to read the file and then apply the fix. The fix will be to add `allow_duplicate=True` to the `Output("error-message-store", "data")` line in whichever callback is missing it.
